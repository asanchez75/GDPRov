<h2 class="list">Introduction</h2>

GDPRov (pronounced as GDPR-prov) is an 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/">OWL2</a> ontology for describing the
provenance of data and consent lifecycles using <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">GDPR</a> terminology. It extends
the existing linked open data provenance ontologies - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROV ontology (PROV-O)</a>
and <a href="http://purl.org/net/p-plan">Ontology for Provenance and Plans (P-Plan)</a>. PROV-O is used to represent
provenance information and is a W3C recommendation. GDPRov uses these
provenance ontologies to express a data-flow model that can trace how consent
and data are used by extending the appropriate vocabulary with GDPR-related
terms.

As the GDPR specifies several requirements over the use of consent and personal
data, the compliance documentation for it requires a provenance trace of 
how the consent and personal data were obtained, and all processes that
act on them. Additionally, GDPR also provides the data subject with several
rights that also require maintaining provenance traces. GDPRov aims to provide
a base ontology for the expression of such provenance traces which can provide
beneficial in the development of compliance related documentation and approaches
as well as GDPR related tools and utilities.
