<h2 class="list">Overview</h2>
Extending provenance ontologies allows GDPRov to express a ‘template’
or ‘plan’ of what should happen (using p-plan:Plan) describing a model of all
activities (as p-plan:Step) that can take place. This template is then instantiated
for (using p-plan:Activity) each specific use of the activity, such as obtaining
consent or data for a particular user. Additionally, the provenance of the activities
themselves can be expressed (using PROV-O and P-Plan) to record how they
change over time, making it possible to trace the change in activities along with
how they interact with consent and data. This is beneficial in documenting the
state of a system as a set of activities that deal with consent and data, and
can be helpful in determining changes in consent when the interactions between
data and an activity change over time. For example, differences in provenance
of an activity can show that it uses personal data it did not previously use.
Depending on the consent obtained for that particular user, this may or may not
need additional permissions, and therefore require obtaining consent to permit
such use.
