<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires justification of data activities to acquire, use, share, and store data using consent obtained from the user. Failure to comply may result in significant heavy fines which incentivises creation and maintenance of records for all activities involving consent and data. Compliance documentation therefore requires provenance information outlining consent and data lifecycles to demonstrate correct usage of data in accordance with the related consent provided and updated by the user. GDPRov (pronounced GDPR-Prov) is a linked data ontology for expressing provenance of consent and data lifecycles with a view towards documenting compliance. GDPRov is an OWL2 ontology that extends PROV-O and P-Plan to model the provenance.</span>
